The purpose of this program is to convert a Starcraft replay into an AI
script which can be injected into the game. This is helpful for learning
new builds or creating AIs for campaigns or just for fun.

With the GUI version, converting a replay is simple.

1. Run rep2ai.exe
2. File->Open
3. Select the replay of your choice
4. Select the player you want from the dropdown
5. Use File->Run to launch StarCraft with this AI, or use File->Save to 
aiscript.bin to export the ai for modding
