The purpose of this program is to convert a Starcraft replay into an AI
script which can be injected into the game. This is helpful for learning
new builds or creating AIs for campaigns or just for fun.

All you need to do is provide rep2ai with a replay file and a player 
name. It will take care of the rest. It will output a new aiscript.bin 
file which can be injected into the game in several different ways.

Syntax: rep2ai -f filename -p player
